<h4>Personal</h4>
When I'm not practicing Welsh flashcards or working on my Spanish, I'm
usually knitting or crocheting or cross-stitching the latest in a long
line of projects. Or I'm singing along to the Hamilton soundtrack. My
latest non-textile and non-musical obsession is crockpot freezer
meals, which take up way too much space in my fridge, but are entirely
worth it.

and grants, check out my blog post for UA's GradFunding newsletter [here](https://grad.arizona.edu/ofce/articles/2017/02/spotlight-elise-bell-eapsi)!

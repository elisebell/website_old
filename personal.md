<h4>Personal</h4>
When I'm not practicing Welsh flashcards or working on my Spanish, I'm
usually knitting or crocheting or cross-stitching the latest in a long
line of projects. Or I'm singing along to the Hamilton soundtrack. My
latest non-textile and non-musical obsession is crockpot freezer
meals, which take up way too much space in my fridge, but are entirely
worth it.

<b>Current favorite weird thing in Welsh</b>:
'Valuable' is *gwerthfawr*, but 'invaluable' is *amhrisiadwy*. This
makes sense if you actually decompose them both, I suppose, but I'm going to stay bitter about it for a
little while.

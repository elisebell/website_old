<h4>Research</h4>

I'm an alumna member of the
[SPAM Lab](http://www.u.arizona.edu/~hammond/spamho.html) at the UA
Department of Linguistics.

<h4>Welsh</h4>
My current research focuses on the production of Welsh vowel length by
Spanish-Welsh bilinguals in Argentina.

Results of a portion of my dissertation fieldwork in Argentina were
presented at LSA 2017 in Austin, TX as a [poster](http://elisebell.github.io/EBell_LSA2017_poster.pdf).

Much of my previous and ongoing research has relied on the Bangor
Siarad and Bangor Patagonia corpora, developed by Bangor University's
Centre for Research on Bilingualism and available at
(http://bangortalk.org.uk/). My master's thesis (*Phonemic vowel
length in Welsh-Spanish bilingual speech*) compared vowel durations
produced by Welsh bilinguals from both corpora. I found that despite
long-term bilingualism with Spanish, the way contrastive vowel length
is realized in the Argentinean dialect of Welsh is no different than
how it is realized in the Northern Welsh dialect in Wales. I presented
a [poster]({{ site.url }}/website/EBell_LSA2016_WelshSpanishBiling_poster.pdf)
summarizing my results at the 2016 LSA Annual Meeting.

[//]: # production of obstruent consonants by children acquiring North
[//]: # Australian Kriol. Results from that research were presented at the
[//]: # Australian Linguistic Society 2015 meeting, and at the Linguistic
[//]: # Society of America 2016 Annual Meeting (slides [here]({{ site.url }}/website/EBell_LSA2016_EAPSI_Kriol.pdf)).

<h4>Scottish Gaelic</h4>
I previously worked with Andrew Carnie and Mike Hammond (and others)
on two investigations of Scottish Gaelic, one examining initial
consonant mutation, and one examining the processes of epenthesis and
hiatus in the language.

<h4>Ngigua</h4>
In 2014, I worked with Heidi Harley and other students in Linguistic
Elicitation and Documentation (LING 588) to
document an underdocumented Mexican language, Ngigua. I investigated
Ngigua's rare system of onset-dependent stress, and presented my
findings at the 18th annual Workshop on American Indigenous Languages
(WAIL) at UC Santa Barbara in 2015. You can view my slides
from that presentation [here]({{ site.url }}/website/WAIL2015_ebell.pdf).

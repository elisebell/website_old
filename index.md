I'm a 3rd year PhD student in the [Department of Linguistics](http://www.linguistics.arizona.edu) at the University of Arizona. My primary research interests are in bilingual phonetics and phonology, focusing on Celtic and Native American languages.

I'm currently working (with my advisor [Dr. Mike Hammond](http://www.u.arizona.edu/~hammond/) and others) on an NSF-funded grant investigating the Welsh system of initial consonant mutations.

My dissertation research will investigate the distribution of vowel quality and quantity distinctions in the dialect(s) of Welsh spoken in Argentina.

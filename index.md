I'm a Visiting Assistant Professor at the University of Texas at El Paso, in the [Language and Linguistics](https://academics.utep.edu/Default.aspx?tabid=44572) department.

I received my PhD from the [Department of Linguistics](http://www.linguistics.arizona.edu) at the University of Arizona. 

My primary research interests are in bilingual phonetics and phonology, focusing on Celtic and Native American languages.

I'm currently working (with my advisor [Dr. Mike Hammond](http://www.u.arizona.edu/~hammond/), [Skye Anderson](https://linguistics.arizona.edu/user/skye-anderson), and others) investigating the Welsh system of initial consonant mutations.

My dissertation research investigated the distribution of vowel quality and quantity distinctions in the dialect(s) of Welsh spoken in Argentina, specifically, how the perception and production of Welsh vowels is affected by bilingualism with Spanish, rather than with English.

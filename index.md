I'm a 5th year PhD student in the [Department of Linguistics](http://www.linguistics.arizona.edu) at the University of Arizona. My primary research interests are in bilingual phonetics and phonology, focusing on Celtic and Native American languages.

I'm currently working (with my advisor [Dr. Mike Hammond](http://www.u.arizona.edu/~hammond/) and others) on an NSF-funded grant investigating the Welsh system of initial consonant mutations.

My dissertation research investigates the distribution of vowel quality and quantity distinctions in the dialect(s) of Welsh spoken in Argentina.

Thank you for your interest in our experiment! You don't have to take part in this research if you don't want to, and nothing bad will happen if you choose not to.  If you start and decide you don't want to keep going, you can stop anytime and your data will not be recorded. 
<br><br>
If you decide to participate, the work could take up to half an hour. Most participants finish in ten minutes or less. You might:

<ul class="a">
  <li>Listen to sounds or words or parts of words in Welsh, some played with noise, and press a button on a computer to say if what you heard was a real word or not, or what sounds you heard, or how much like a real word the thing sounded, or that sort of thing. </li>
  <li>Answer some questions about how old you were when you learned each language you speak, how often you speak Welsh with friends or family, or that sort of thing.
</li>
</ul>

There are no special risks to this study.
<br><br>
There is no benefit directly to you from participating in this research, except that you might find it satisfying to help create a record of the language and help people understand more about it.  The project has a general benefit to others, especially for helping people learn to speak Welsh.  It doesn't cost you anything to participate other than your time.
